Mandatory Update
==============

GOSSIP Core v2.0.0 is a mandatory update for all users.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/GOSSIP-Qt (on Mac) or gossipd/gossip-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

GOSSIP Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP and we do not support Windows XP installations!

GOSSIP Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.
